## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 Release Highlights

This inaugural release establishes SEP DSL as a production-ready AGI coherence framework with real-world applications. Key achievements:

1. **Proven Performance**: Backtested trading system with 60%+ accuracy
2. **Universal Access**: C API enables integration with any programming language
3. **Community Ready**: Comprehensive documentation and contribution guidelines
4. **Production Deployed**: Autonomous trading system operational since August 2025

### Breaking Changes
- N/A (initial release)

### Migration Guide
- N/A (initial release)

### Known Issues
- Variable access in DSLRuntime requires pattern-scoped retrieval
- CUDA support requires specific driver versions (see documentation)
- Ruby bindings require manual compilation until gem publication

### Upcoming in v1.1.0
- Python bindings (`pip install sep-dsl`)
- JavaScript/Node.js bindings (`npm install sep-dsl`)
- IDE integration with syntax highlighting
- Additional built-in statistical functions
- WebAssembly compilation target
