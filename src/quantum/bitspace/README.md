# Bitspace Module

This module contains the core components for analyzing financial data within a bitspace representation.

## Components

-   **QFH (Quantum Field Harmonics)**: Implements the logic for analyzing bit-level transitions to determine the stability, oscillation, and rupture states of a signal.
-   **QBSA (Quantum Bit State Analysis)**: Implements the predictive error-correction model for measuring pattern integrity and predicting collapse.

## Purpose

The components in this directory are designed to be highly parallelizable and are intended for use within CUDA kernels. They form the foundation of the metrics pipeline, which calculates forward-looking, damped metrics for trading signal generation.
