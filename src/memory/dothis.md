This is an incredibly detailed and well-documented project! The architecture, modularity, and depth of the theoretical foundation (`THESIS.md`) are truly impressive. It's clear you've put a tremendous amount of effort into this.

Let's tackle your "12 fucking hours" frustration with the memory tier manager tests. The failures you're seeing (`MemoryTierManagerTest.PromotionAndDemotion`, `MemoryTierManagerTest.DefragmentationTriggersPromotionDemotion`, `MemoryTierManagerTest.OptimizeBlocksPromotionDemotion`) all point to related issues with how patterns are being promoted/demoted and how utilization is calculated or expected to change.

The core issue likely lies in the interaction between `MemoryTierManager` and `QuantumCoherenceManager`, specifically in how `MemoryTierManager::updateBlockMetrics` determines the target tier and how `promoteToTier` actually moves the block and updates utilization.

Here's an outline to follow to debug and fix these tests, focusing on the `MemoryTierManager` and its interaction with `QuantumCoherenceManager`.

---

**Debugging Outline for MemoryTierManager Tests**

**Goal:** Understand why `getTierUtilization` is not `0.0f` for MTM when an item is expected to be promoted *out* of STM into MTM, and why `promoted` is `nullptr` after a promotion attempt.

**Hypothesis:**
1.  The `determineTier` logic within `MemoryTierManager::updateBlockMetrics` (or its internal call to `determineTier`) might not be correctly identifying the target tier, or the conditions for promotion aren't met as expected by the test.
2.  The `promoteToTier` function is failing to allocate the new block or move data, resulting in `nullptr`.
3.  Utilization calculation/updates within `MemoryTier` or `MemoryTierManager` are not reflecting the changes after allocation/deallocation/promotion.

---

### **Step 1: Focus on `MemoryTierManagerTest.PromotionAndDemotion`**

This is the simplest failing test. Let's break it down.

**Test Snippet Analysis:**

```cpp
// tests/memory/memory_tier_manager_test.cpp:29-39
TEST(MemoryTierManagerTest, PromotionAndDemotion) {
    MemoryTierManager mgr; // Uses default config
    // ...
    // Allocate in STM
    MemoryBlock* block = mgr.allocate(256, MemoryTierEnum::STM);
    ASSERT_NE(block, nullptr);
    ASSERT_EQ(mgr.getTierUtilization(MemoryTierEnum::MTM), 0.0f); // FAILS HERE: Expected 0.0f, Actual 0.000244140625
    ASSERT_GT(mgr.getTierUtilization(MemoryTierEnum::LTM), 0.0f); // FAILS HERE: Expected >0.0f, Actual 0

    // Simulate conditions for promotion to MTM
    // The test sets coherence, stability, generation directly on the *block*
    // but the tier manager's updateBlockMetrics might be the one calling determineTier
    // so ensure the values passed to it are as expected.
    // ...
    // Call updateBlockMetrics indirectly (e.g., via optimizeBlocks) or directly
    // This part of the test is missing from your snippet, but it's crucial.
    // Let's assume there's a call like:
    MemoryBlock* promoted = mgr.updateBlockMetrics(block, 0.8f, 0.8f, 10, 1.0f); // Simulate good values for MTM
    ASSERT_NE(promoted, nullptr); // FAILS HERE: Expected non-nullptr, Actual nullptr
}
```

**Immediate Observations:**

*   `mgr.getTierUtilization(MemoryTierEnum::MTM)` fails after initial allocation in STM. This implies that the initial `MemoryTierManager` constructor might be doing something unexpected, or the default `MemoryTier` initialization.
*   `mgr.getTierUtilization(MemoryTierEnum::LTM)` fails (expected > 0, actual 0). This suggests either LTM is somehow involved in the first failure, or it's a separate issue indicating LTM isn't being initialized or used correctly.

---

### **Step 2: Investigate `MemoryTierManager` Initialization and Default Config**

The first failures suggest an issue right at the start.

1.  **Examine `MemoryTierManager::MemoryTierManager()` and `MemoryTierManager::init()`:**
    *   Look at `src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp`.
    *   Trace the `init(cfg)` call.
    *   Are `stm_`, `mtm_`, `ltm_` being correctly `std::make_unique`'d with proper sizes?
    *   **Crucially:** What are the default sizes (`config_.stm_size`, `config_.mtm_size`, `config_.ltm_size`) being passed to the `MemoryTier` constructors?
        *   The default `MemoryTierManager` constructor calls `init` which relies on `sep::config::ConfigManager::getInstance().getMemoryConfig()`.
        *   **Check `CONFIG_OPTIONS.md` or the relevant config file (`config.json`) for default memory tier sizes.**
        *   If `MTM` or `LTM` are getting non-zero sizes, but no blocks are allocated *into* them initially, their utilization should be `0.0f`.
        *   **Verify `MemoryTier::calculateUtilization()`:**
            ```cpp
            float MemoryTier::calculateUtilization() const {
               if (config_.size == 0 || used_space_ == 0) return 0.0f;
               float util = static_cast<float>(used_space_) / static_cast<float>(config_.size);
               return util > 1.0f ? 1.0f : util;  // Cap at 100%
            }
            ```
            This looks correct. So if `config_.size` is non-zero and `used_space_` is zero, it should return `0.0f`.
            *   **The error `Actual 0.000244140625` suggests that `used_space_` is somehow non-zero for MTM *before* any explicit allocation into it in the test.** This is very suspicious.
            *   **Add print statements to `MemoryTier::allocate` and `MemoryTier::deallocate` to see `used_space_` changes.**
            *   **Add print statements in `MemoryTier` constructor and destructor to confirm `used_space_` is 0 initially.**
            *   **Add print statements in `MemoryTierManager::init` right after `stm_`, `mtm_`, `ltm_` are created, printing their initial `getTierUtilization()`.**

2.  **Verify `MemoryTierEnum` values:** (Likely not the issue, but quick check)
    *   Confirm `MemoryTierEnum::MTM` and `MemoryTierEnum::LTM` are distinct and correctly mapped in `MemoryTierManager::getTier()`.

---

### **Step 3: Debug the `promoteToTier` Failure (nullptr promoted block)**

The `ASSERT_NE(promoted, nullptr);` failure is critical. This means the promotion process itself is breaking.

1.  **Trace `MemoryTierManager::updateBlockMetrics`:**
    *   This function calls `determineTier` to decide where the block *should* go.
    *   Then it calls `promoteToTier` if the target tier is different.
    *   **Add `SPDLOG_DEBUG` statements or `printf` calls to `MemoryTierManager::updateBlockMetrics`** (and `MemoryTier::determineTier` if it's a separate helper) to log:
        *   Input `coherence`, `stability`, `generation`.
        *   `block->tier` (current tier).
        *   `target_tier_ptr->getType()` (determined target tier).
        *   The `SEPResult` returned by `promoteToTier`.
        *   The returned `new_block` from `promoteToTier`.

2.  **Deep Dive into `MemoryTierManager::promoteToTier`:**
    *   **The most likely culprit is `dst_tier->allocate(block->size);`** or `dst_tier->moveData(out_block, block);` failing.
    *   **Add `SPDLOG_DEBUG` statements or `printf` calls within `promoteToTier`:**
        *   Before `dst_tier->allocate(block->size);` - print `block->size` and `target_tier`.
        *   After `dst_tier->allocate(block->size);` - print whether `out_block` is `nullptr` and why (e.g., `dst_tier->getFreeSpace()`).
        *   After `dst_tier->defragment();` if it gets called - print `dst_tier->getFreeSpace()` again.
        *   After `dst_tier->moveData(out_block, block);` - print whether it returned `true`/`false`.
        *   Check the `CUDA_CHECK` macros within `MemoryTier::moveData` if CUDA is involved. Even if `SEP_MEMORY_HAS_CUDA` is defined, if CUDA is not actually initialized or configured, `cudaMallocManaged` or `cudaMemcpyAsync` could fail.

3.  **Check `MemoryTier::allocate()` for potential issues:**
    *   Ensure `MemoryTier::allocate()` itself is robust. It tries defragmentation once. If it still returns `nullptr`, that's the root cause.
    *   What's the default size of MTM? If it's too small for even a single 256-byte block, then `allocate` will fail.
    *   **MemoryTierManager Config Defaults:**
        *   `MemoryTierManager::getInstance()` is called once, and its config is loaded from `sep::config::ConfigManager::getInstance().getMemoryConfig()`.
        *   **Check `sep_snapshot_20250707_090525.txt` for `src/memory/memory_tier_manager_serialization.cpp`.**
            *   ```cpp
                // Defaults for MemoryTierManager::Config
                c.stm_size = j.value("stm_size", static_cast<std::size_t>(1 << 20)); // 1MB
                c.mtm_size = j.value("mtm_size", static_cast<std::size_t>(4 << 20)); // 4MB
                c.ltm_size = j.value("ltm_size", static_cast<std::size_t>(16 << 20)); // 16MB
                // ... thresholds
                ```
            *   These sizes are sufficiently large (1MB for STM, 4MB for MTM) to hold a 256-byte block. So `allocate` failing for lack of space is unlikely unless some other part of the system is pre-allocating a huge amount.

4.  **Confirm the test's simulation values align with `determineTier` logic:**
    *   In `src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp`, `determineTier` uses `config_.promote_stm_to_mtm` and `config_.mtm_to_ltm_min_gen`.
    *   The test uses `mgr.updateBlockMetrics(block, 0.8f, 0.8f, 10, 1.0f);`
        *   `0.8f` for coherence/stability is usually `promote_stm_to_mtm` threshold, which defaults to `0.7f`. So `0.8f` should indeed trigger promotion to MTM.
        *   `10` for generation is also above `stm_to_mtm_min_gen` (`5u`).
    *   So the *conditions* for promotion seem correct. The issue is likely in the `promoteToTier` *implementation*.

---

### **Step 4: Cross-Check `MemoryTierManager::updateBlockMetrics`**

```cpp
// From src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp
MemoryBlock *MemoryTierManager::updateBlockMetrics(MemoryBlock *block,
                                                   float coherence,
                                                   float stability,
                                                   uint32_t generation,
                                                   float context_score) {
  if (!block || !block->allocated) return block; // Problem: if block isn't allocated, it still returns block.
    block->coherence = coherence;
    block->stability = stability;
    block->generation = generation;
    block->weight = context_score; // This is a copy of the block, not from the deque.
    MemoryTier* current_tier_ptr = getTier(block->tier);
    if (!current_tier_ptr) return block; // Should not happen
    MemoryTier* target_tier_ptr = determineTier(coherence, stability, generation);
    if (!target_tier_ptr || target_tier_ptr == current_tier_ptr) {
        return block; // No move needed
    }

    MemoryBlock* new_block = nullptr;
    SEPResult result = promoteToTier(block, target_tier_ptr->getType(), new_block);

    if (result == SEPResult::SUCCESS) {
        return new_block;
    }

    // If migration failed, return the original block.
    return block; // If promoteToTier returns failure, you get the original block.
                  // But the test EXPECTS new_block != nullptr if it succeeded, which means
                  // it expects this function to return nullptr if it failed to promote.
}
```

*   **Potential Issue 1: `block->allocated` check:** The `if (!block || !block->allocated)` check is slightly problematic. If `block` is not allocated, `updateBlockMetrics` returns the *same* unallocated `block` pointer. If the test then checks `ASSERT_NE(promoted, nullptr)`, it might pass if `block` itself isn't null, but it's not actually *promoted*. However, the test allocates `block` and `ASSERT_NE(block, nullptr)` for the initial allocation, so `block->allocated` should be `true` at the time of calling `updateBlockMetrics`.
*   **Potential Issue 2: Returning `block` on failure:** `updateBlockMetrics` returns the *original* `block` if `promoteToTier` fails. The test `ASSERT_NE(promoted, nullptr)` implies that `promoted` *should* be a new, valid pointer if promotion occurs. If `promoteToTier` fails, `updateBlockMetrics` returns the old block, which might be non-null, but it's not the *promoted* block.
    *   **Proposed Fix:** The test explicitly expects `promoted` to be non-`nullptr` *and* *different* from the original `block`. The `updateBlockMetrics` should probably return `nullptr` if it tried to promote but failed, or handle the failure gracefully. For now, focus on making `promoteToTier` succeed.

---

### **Step 5: Address `MemoryTierManagerTest.PromotionAndDemotion` - First Failure `Expected equality of these values: mgr.getTierUtilization(MemoryTierEnum::MTM) Which is: 0.000244140625 0.0f`**

This is really strange. An initial allocation in STM should *not* affect MTM or LTM utilization if the calculation is correct and no blocks are assigned to them.

*   **Review `MemoryTierManager::getInstance()` and its `std::call_once` initialization.** Is it possible that in some test run or previous setup, `MemoryTierManager`'s internal state (like `mtm_->used_space_`) is getting corrupted or not reset?
*   **Add a `MemoryTierManager::resetForTesting()` method** to explicitly clear all tiers, reset `used_space_`, and clear `lookup_map_` before each test that manipulates memory.
    *   This is a common pattern for singletons in unit tests.
    *   Call this in `SetUp()` for your `MemoryTierManagerTest` fixture.
    *   This is the most likely solution for `mgr.getTierUtilization(MemoryTierEnum::MTM), 0.0f` failing initially.

---

### **Step 6: Example of Adding Debugging Logs (Conceptual)**

```cpp
// In src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp, in init()
void MemoryTierManager::init(const Config& config) {
  config_ = config;
  MemoryTier::Config scfg{MemoryTierEnum::STM, config_.stm_size};
  MemoryTier::Config mcfg{MemoryTierEnum::MTM, config_.mtm_size};
  MemoryTier::Config lcfg{MemoryTierEnum::LTM, config_.ltm_size};

  stm_ = std::make_unique<MemoryTier>(scfg);
  mtm_ = std::make_unique<MemoryTier>(mcfg);
  ltm_ = std::make_unique<MemoryTier>(lcfg);

  // Add these lines
  printf("DEBUG: MTM init - MTM size: %zu, MTM used: %zu, MTM util: %f\n",
         mtm_->getSize(), mtm_->getUsedSpace(), mtm_->calculateUtilization());
  printf("DEBUG: LTM init - LTM size: %zu, LTM used: %zu, LTM util: %f\n",
         ltm_->getSize(), ltm_->getUsedSpace(), ltm_->calculateUtilization());

   if (config_.use_redis) {
    redis_manager_ = persistence::createRedisManager(config_.redis_host, config_.redis_port);
    }
}

// In MemoryTier::allocate()
MemoryBlock *MemoryTier::allocate(std::size_t size) {
    // ... existing code ...
    printf("DEBUG: Tier %d - Allocated %zu bytes. Used space now: %zu. Total size: %zu. Util: %f\n",
           static_cast<int>(config_.type), size, used_space_, config_.size, calculateUtilization());
    return block;
}

// In MemoryTierManager::promoteToTier()
SEPResult MemoryTierManager::promoteToTier(MemoryBlock* block,
                                         MemoryTierEnum target_tier,
                                         MemoryBlock*& out_block) {
    printf("DEBUG: promoteToTier - Promoting block from %d to %d, size %zu\n",
           static_cast<int>(block->tier), static_cast<int>(target_tier), block->size);

    // ... existing code ...

    out_block = dst_tier->allocate(block->size);
    if (!out_block) {
        printf("DEBUG: promoteToTier - FAILED to allocate in dest tier %d. Free space: %zu\n",
               static_cast<int>(target_tier), dst_tier->getFreeSpace());
        // ... rest of allocate retry logic ...
    }
    printf("DEBUG: promoteToTier - Allocated new block at %p in dest tier %d\n",
           static_block, static_cast<int>(target_tier));

    if (!dst_tier->moveData(out_block, block)) {
        printf("DEBUG: promoteToTier - FAILED to move data.\n");
        // ...
    }

    printf("DEBUG: promoteToTier - Successfully promoted. Old block: %p, New block: %p\n",
           block->ptr, out_block->ptr);
    return SEPResult::SUCCESS;
}
```

---

### **Step 7: Re-evaluate `MemoryTierManagerTest.PromotionAndDemotion` test body**

Ensure that the test is properly simulating the conditions for promotion. A minimal working test might look like this:

```cpp
// Add to your test class fixture:
class MemoryTierManagerTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
    // This is a simplified reset. In a real scenario, you might need to rebuild the whole manager.
    void SetUp() override {
        // Force re-initialization of the singleton or reset its state
        // This is often tricky with singletons. A full teardown/setup of the manager
        // might be needed, or expose a private reset method for testing.
        // For now, let's assume `getInstance` re-initializes itself correctly
        // for each test if previous tests failed to clean up.
        // A common pattern is to reset its internal state:
        // MemoryTierManager::getInstance().resetForTesting(); // You would need to add this method.
        // Or, use a non-singleton instance for tests if possible (best practice).
        // For now, let's assume `mgr` is a fresh instance for each test.
    }
};

TEST_F(MemoryTierManagerTest, PromotionAndDemotion) {
    // Manually create a new manager instance to ensure clean state for the test
    // This bypasses the singleton and its potential lingering state from previous tests.
    // If MemoryTierManager *must* be a singleton, then you *must* implement a test-only reset.
    sep::memory::MemoryTierManager mgr; // This line already exists in your test

    // 1. Allocate in STM - check STM utilization
    size_t block_size_bytes = 256;
    sep::memory::MemoryBlock* block_stm = mgr.allocate(block_size_bytes, sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::STM);
    ASSERT_NE(block_stm, nullptr);
    ASSERT_GT(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::STM), 0.0f);
    // Crucial check: MTM and LTM should be 0.0f if nothing is there yet
    // If this fails, the issue is in MemoryTier::calculateUtilization or MemoryTier initialization.
    // The previous error was: Expected 0.0f, Actual 0.000244140625
    // This indicates some residual allocation or incorrect calculation in MTM/LTM.
    ASSERT_EQ(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::MTM), 0.0f); // Fix based on your failure
    ASSERT_EQ(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::LTM), 0.0f); // Fix based on your failure

    // 2. Simulate conditions for promotion: Update the block's internal metrics
    // The test framework uses a mock/simplified update:
    // mgr.updateBlockMetrics(block, 0.8f, 0.8f, 10, 1.0f);
    // Let's assume the test calls this for an STM block to MTM values.
    // coherence: 0.8f (above default 0.7f for STM->MTM)
    // stability: 0.8f (above default 0.7f for STM->MTM)
    // generation: 10 (above default 5 for STM->MTM)

    // Call updateBlockMetrics on the STM block to trigger promotion logic
    sep::memory::MemoryBlock* promoted_block = mgr.updateBlockMetrics(block_stm, 0.8f, 0.8f, 10, 1.0f);
    
    // 3. Assert on the promoted block and tier utilizations
    ASSERT_NE(promoted_block, nullptr) << "Promoted block should not be null.";
    ASSERT_EQ(promoted_block->tier, sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::MTM) << "Block should be in MTM after promotion.";
    ASSERT_NE(promoted_block->ptr, block_stm->ptr) << "Promoted block should have a different address.";

    // After successful promotion, STM utilization should drop (block deallocated from STM)
    // and MTM utilization should increase (block allocated to MTM).
    // The previous test expects STM to go to 0.0, which means the initial allocation was small
    // enough that deallocating it would make STM empty again.
    ASSERT_EQ(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::STM), 0.0f) << "STM utilization should be 0.0f after promotion.";
    ASSERT_GT(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::MTM), 0.0f) << "MTM utilization should be greater than 0.0f after promotion.";
    ASSERT_EQ(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::LTM), 0.0f) << "LTM utilization should remain 0.0f.";

    // 4. Test demotion back to STM (or LTM to MTM if testing that path next)
    // For simplicity, let's just test deallocation of the promoted block
    mgr.deallocate(promoted_block);
    ASSERT_EQ(mgr.getTierUtilization(sep::memory::MemoryTierEnum::MTM), 0.0f) << "MTM utilization should be 0.0f after deallocation.";
}
```

---

### **Summary of Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Crucial first fix:** Implement a `resetForTesting()` method for `MemoryTierManager` (if it's a true singleton being reused across tests), or ensure the `MemoryTierManager` instance is completely fresh for each test to address the `0.000244140625` residual utilization. The fact that the `MemoryTierManager mgr;` line is *inside* your `TEST` suggests it *should* be a fresh instance, implying the issue might be deeper (e.g., static variables in `MemoryTier` itself or issues with `MemoryTier`'s destructor/constructor).
    *   **Strongly suspect:** The `MemoryTier` destructor or constructor is leaving `used_space_` in a bad state, or the `MemoryTier` constructor is performing an allocation that isn't accounted for as "used" by the test.
    *   **Check `MemoryTier::MemoryTier()` and `MemoryTier::~MemoryTier()` implementations very carefully regarding `memory_pool_` and `used_space_`.** Ensure `used_space_` correctly tracks allocations and deallocations. If a `std::malloc` or `cudaMallocManaged` happens in the constructor for the initial `blocks_` entry, that needs to be reflected in `used_space_` or excluded from `calculateUtilization` in context of "initial zero utilization". (It should represent used memory by *allocated blocks*, not free space blocks).
    *   In `MemoryTier::MemoryTier` constructor: `blocks_.push_back(MemoryBlock(memory_pool_, config.size, 0, config.type));` this creates a *free* block. It should not increment `used_space_`. `used_space_` should only increment when `block->allocated = true;` happens. This part seems correct in your `allocate()` method.

2.  **Add `printf` debugging statements** as outlined in Step 6 to `MemoryTierManager::init`, `MemoryTier::allocate`, `MemoryTier::deallocate`, and `MemoryTierManager::promoteToTier`. Print sizes, addresses, `used_space_`, and `SEPResult` values. This will give you very clear insight into where the process breaks down.

3.  **Validate `promoteToTier` logic:** Ensure that if `dst_tier->allocate` fails, it's handled correctly (i.e., `out_block` truly remains `nullptr`). Also, confirm the `src_tier->deallocate(block)` happens only after the successful copy to `dst_tier`.

4.  Once `PromotionAndDemotion` passes, `DefragmentationTriggersPromotionDemotion` and `OptimizeBlocksPromotionDemotion` will likely also pass, as they rely on the same underlying promotion mechanisms.


Alright, let's tackle this wall of errors. It looks like you've got a mix of header include issues, namespace problems, and potentially some fundamental type confusion (like `std::string` being seen as `int`!).

The "Too many errors emitted" is just a consequence of the first few errors cascading. We need to focus on the initial ones.

Here is an outline to follow to systematically diagnose and resolve these compilation issues:

---

**Debugging Outline for Compilation Errors**

**Goal:** Eliminate the "Too many errors" fatal errors and get the project compiling cleanly.

**Primary Issues Identified:**

1.  **Missing Header Files (`pp_file_not_found`):** `compat/cuda.h`, `core/common.h`, `memory/memory_tier_manager.hpp`, `core/types.h`, `memory/types.h`, `core/compression.h` are not being found by the compiler when included.
2.  **Type/Namespace Lookup (`unknown_typename`, `undeclared_var_use`, `no_member`, `typename_nested_not_found`):** Types like `MemoryBlock`, `MemoryTierEnum`, `MemoryTier`, `Compressor`, `CompressionType`, `ollama`, and internal standard library types (`_Node_ptr`, `_Tp_alloc_type`) are not recognized. This is often a consequence of missing headers, incorrect include order, or namespace pollution/redefinition.
3.  **Type Redefinition/Confusion (`init_conversion_failed`, `typecheck_comparison_of_pointer_integer`):** Especially the `std::string` (aka 'int') errors. This is a major red flag and indicates some macro or typedef is incorrectly redefining standard library types.
4.  **Syntax/Usage Errors (`expected_class_name`, `override keyword only allowed...`):** Basic C++ syntax or incorrect use of language features.
5.  **Typo:** The stray `e` in `src/memory/memory_tier.cpp`.

---

### **Step 1: Fix the `std::string` Redefinition (Highest Priority)**

This is causing `std::string` to be treated as `int`, leading to cascading errors in standard library usage (`vector`, `map`, string literals).

1.  **Identify the source:** The errors appear first in `/sep/include/core/types.h`. This header is likely including another header *before* the errors occur, and that header is causing the redefinition.
2.  **Examine `/sep/include/core/types.h` (around line 12):** Look at the headers included *before* the first error on line 12 (`compat/cuda.h`).
    *   `#include <string>` (line 8)
    *   `#include <vector>` (line 9)
    *   `#include <map>` (line 10)
    *   `#include <unordered_map>` (line 11)
    *   `#include "engine/internal/cuda.h"` (line 12 - error here)
    *   ... and others after.
3.  **Hypothesis:** A header included *before* `<string>` or `<vector>` is defining a macro or typedef that conflicts with `std::string` or its dependencies. The `compat/shim.h` header is a likely candidate for compatibility layer issues.
4.  **Action:**
    *   Temporarily comment out includes in `/sep/include/core/types.h` one by one, starting from the top, until the `std::string` (aka 'int') errors disappear.
    *   Once you've isolated the problematic include, examine that header file for macros (like `#define string ...`), `typedef`s, or `using` declarations that might be the culprit. Pay close attention to conditional compilation blocks (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`).
    *   **Focus on `compat/shim.h`**: Review this file thoroughly for anything that might affect `std::string`. It includes `<string_view>`, `<vector>`, `<string>`, and has `namespace sep::shim`. It defines `std::string`. Is `std::string` perhaps being aliased globally or used instead of `std::string` where `std::string` is expected?
    *   **Resolution:** Correct the problematic definition or ensure that the code correctly uses `std::string` or `sep::std::string` where intended, without unwanted global redefinitions. If `sep::std::string` is intended as a replacement, ensure all code uses it consistently and correctly, and that it behaves like a string, not an int.

### **Step 2: Address Header File Not Found Errors**

These are straightforward include path issues or missing physical files.

1.  **`'compat/cuda.h' file not found` (in `/sep/include/core/types.h`, line 12):**
    *   Check the `compat` module's public include directory (`include/sep/compat`). Is `cuda.h` actually there?
    *   Refer to `include-compat.md`. The public headers are listed as `core.h`, `kernels.h`, `raii.h`, `memory.h`, `macros.h`, `cuda_common.h`. `cuda.h` is *not* listed as a public header.
    *   **Action:** The include `#include "engine/internal/cuda.h"` in `include/core/types.h` is likely incorrect. Determine what functionality from `compat` is needed in `core/types.h` and include the *correct* public header (e.g., `compat/core.h` if `CudaCore` types are needed, `compat/types.h` if basic `compat` types are needed). Replace `#include "engine/internal/cuda.h"` with the appropriate one.

2.  **`'core/common.h' file not found` (in `/sep/include/memory/memory_tier_manager.hpp`, line 23 and `tests/memory/memory_tier_manager_test.cpp`, line 2):**
    *   The `memory` module and its tests need to include headers from `core`.
    *   **Action:** Check the CMakeLists.txt for the `sep_memory` target (`src/memory/CMakeLists.txt`) and the test target (`tests/CMakeLists.txt`). Ensure that `$CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/include` is correctly added to their `target_include_directories` with appropriate visibility (`PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE`). For includes *between* SEP modules, using `PUBLIC` in the dependency target's `target_include_directories` and linking with `PUBLIC` is often best, but `PRIVATE` includes in the consumer are also necessary if headers in `src` are included. Make sure `core`'s headers (`$CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/include/core`) are reachable from `memory`'s source/include directories.

3.  **`'memory/memory_tier_manager.hpp' file not found` (in `src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp`, line 1):**
    *   A `.cpp` file needs to include its corresponding `.hpp` header.
    *   **Action:** Check the CMakeLists.txt for the `sep_memory` target (`src/memory/CMakeLists.txt`). Ensure `$CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/include` is added to its `target_include_directories` with `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE` visibility. This allows `.cpp` files in `src/memory` to see headers in `include/memory/`.

4.  **`'core/types.h' file not found` (in `/sep/include/memory/types.h`, line 4):**
    *   The `memory` module's types header needs to include `core`'s types header.
    *   **Action:** Similar to point 2, ensure `core`'s include directory (`$CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/include`) is correctly added as a `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE` include for the `sep_memory` target in `src/memory/CMakeLists.txt`.

5.  **`'memory/types.h' file not found` (in `tests/memory/memory_tier_manager_test.cpp`, implicitly):**
    *   The memory tests need memory types.
    *   **Action:** Similar to point 2, ensure `$CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/include` is added to the test target's `target_include_directories` in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`.

6.  **`'core/compression.h' file not found` (in `src/engine/compression.cpp`, line 7):**
    *   A `.cpp` file needs to include its corresponding `.h` header within the *same* module.
    *   **Action:** Check `src/engine/CMakeLists.txt`. Ensure `$CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/src` is added to the `sep_engine` target's `target_include_directories` with `PRIVATE` visibility. This allows `src/engine/*.cpp` files to include `src/engine/*.h` (or `.hpp`) files.

### **Step 3: Fix Typo**

1.  **Action:** Go to `src/memory/memory_tier.cpp`, line 1. Remove the stray character `e`.

---

### **Step 4: Address Type and Namespace Lookup Errors**

Once missing includes are fixed and the `std::string` redefinition is gone, many of these should resolve.

1.  **`Unknown type name 'MemoryBlock'`, `MemoryTierEnum'`, `MemoryTier'`, `Use of undeclared identifier 'MemoryTierEnum'`:** If the header `memory/types.h` and `memory/memory_tier_manager.hpp` are now being found (Step 2), ensure that when these types are used (e.g., in `MemoryTierManagerTest` or `src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp`), they are correctly qualified with their namespace `sep::memory::` (e.g., `sep::memory::MemoryBlock* block;`) or that appropriate `using namespace sep::memory;` declarations are in place *after* the includes. The errors themselves often suggest the correct qualified name (e.g., `did you mean 'sep::memory::MemoryBlock'?`).
2.  **`undeclared identifier 'Compressor'`, `CompressionType'`:** If `core/compression.h` is now found (Step 2), ensure the `Compressor` class and `CompressionType` enum are correctly defined within the `sep::core` namespace and are used with the correct qualification or `using` declarations.
3.  **`No member named 'ollama' in namespace 'sep'` (in `include/core/types.h`, line 101):**
    *   The `EngineConfig` struct has a member `ollama` of type `ollama::OllamaConfig`.
    *   **Action:** Ensure the header defining `sep::ollama::OllamaConfig` (`api/ollama_types.h`) is included in `include/core/types.h` *before* `EngineConfig` is defined. Also, ensure the include paths for `api` headers are correct in `core`'s CMakeLists.txt.

---

### **Step 5: Fix Syntax and Usage Errors**

1.  **`Expected class name` (in `src/engine/compression.cpp`, line 16):** `class DefaultCompressor : public Compressor`. This means `Compressor` is not recognized as a class *at this point*.
    *   **Action:** Ensure the definition of `Compressor` in `core/compression.h` appears *before* `DefaultCompressor` in `src/engine/compression.cpp`. Standard practice is to declare the base class in the header and define derived classes in the `.cpp`. Make sure `src/engine/compression.cpp` includes `core/compression.h` at the top.
2.  **`override keyword only allowed on virtual member functions` (in `src/engine/compression.cpp`):** This means the `compress` and `decompress` methods in the base class `Compressor` are not marked as `virtual`.
    *   **Action:** In the `Compressor` definition in `core/compression.h`, add the `virtual` keyword to the declarations of `compress` and `decompress`.
3.  **`typecheck_nonviable_condition` (in `src/engine/compression.cpp`, line 63):** `return std::make_unique<DefaultCompressor>();` is trying to return `std::unique_ptr<DefaultCompressor>` but the compiler thinks the function (`createCompressor`) returns `int`. This strongly reinforces the idea that return types or `std::unique_ptr` itself is messed up by the `std::string` redefinition.
    *   **Action:** This error should resolve after Step 1 is complete. If not, check the declaration of `createCompressor` in `core/compression.h` to ensure it's correctly declared as returning `std::unique_ptr<Compressor>`.

---

### **Step 6: Rebuild and Verify**

1.  **Clean:** Run `make clean` in your build directory (`/sep/sep_build/build`).
2.  **Reconfigure:** Re-run CMake (`cmake ..` from the build directory). Check the CMake output for any errors related to finding libraries or configuring targets.
3.  **Build:** Run `make -j$(nproc)` again.
4.  **Test:** If the build succeeds, run `ctest` to see if the memory tests (and others) now pass.
