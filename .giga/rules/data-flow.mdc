## Core Pattern Processing Flow
The pattern processing pipeline flows through multiple stages:

1. Input Pattern Ingestion
- Raw patterns enter through src/api/bridge.cpp
- Patterns undergo quantum state mapping in src/quantum/processor.cpp
- Initial coherence metrics calculated 
- Pattern assigned to STM tier

2. Pattern Evolution
- Patterns evolve through quantum state transitions in memory tiers:
  - STM: Initial pattern storage, coherence validation
  - MTM: Patterns meeting stability thresholds
  - LTM: Highly stable, generationally proven patterns
- Evolution tracked through src/quantum/pattern_evolution.cpp

3. Quantum State Transformations
- Patterns undergo state changes based on:
  - Coherence levels
  - Stability metrics 
  - Generational age
  - Usage frequency
- State management handled by src/quantum/quantum_processor.cpp

4. Memory Tier Transitions
- Coherence thresholds trigger promotion/demotion
- src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp controls:
  - Pattern migration between tiers
  - Tier utilization optimization
  - Pattern relationship preservation
  - Coherence-based defragmentation

5. Pattern Analysis Output
- Pattern metrics flow to src/quantum/pattern_metric_engine.cpp
- Trading signals generated based on:
  - Pattern coherence
  - Stability metrics
  - Quantum state analysis
- Results pushed through API endpoints

Key Data Flow Components:
- Pattern ingestion and quantum mapping
- Multi-tier memory transitions
- State-based pattern evolution
- Coherence-driven optimization
- Signal generation pipeline

The system maintains quantum-inspired pattern processing with sophisticated memory management and state transitions, focused on pattern evolution and relationship preservation.
