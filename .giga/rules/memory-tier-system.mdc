## Core Memory Architecture

Three-tier memory hierarchy with distinct characteristics and transition rules:

1. STM (Short-term Memory)
- Default tier for new patterns
- Retains data for 1 hour
- Promotion requires coherence > 0.7 and generation > 5

2. MTM (Medium-term Memory) 
- Intermediate storage for evolved patterns
- 7 day retention period
- Promotion requires coherence > 0.9 and stability > 0.8

3. LTM (Long-term Memory)
- Permanent storage for stable patterns
- Compressed storage with quantum state preservation
- Demotion triggered by coherence < 0.3

## Pattern Evolution System

Quantum-inspired pattern management with:

1. Coherence Calculation
```cpp
coherence = (baseCoherence * 0.4) + 
           (stability * 0.3) + 
           (generationBonus * 0.2) +
           (accessFrequency * 0.1)
```

2. Pattern Properties
- Stability metrics from quantum state analysis
- Generation tracking for evolutionary progress
- Access frequency monitoring
- Quantum state coherence measurements

3. Tier Migration Rules
- Promotion triggered by exceeding tier thresholds
- Demotion based on coherence decay
- Hysteresis prevention through minimum dwell time
- Migration tracking with quantum state preservation

## Memory Management Logic

1. Block Allocation
- Dynamic sizing based on pattern complexity
- Fragmentation monitoring (30% threshold)
- Automatic defragmentation
- Quantum state-aware block placement

2. Pattern Storage
- Relationship preservation during tier transitions
- Quantum entanglement tracking between patterns
- Coherence-based storage optimization
- Pattern lineage preservation

3. Pattern Loading
- Priority-based retrieval system
- Quantum state reconstruction
- Cache coherence maintenance
- Relationship graph preservation
