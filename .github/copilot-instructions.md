## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Architecture

The system implements a quantum-inspired pattern analysis engine for financial markets with three key components:

1. Quantum Pattern Processing (`src/quantum/*`)
- Three-state quantum system tracking NULL_STATE, FLIP, and RUPTURE transitions
- Pattern coherence calculation using quantum mechanics principles
- Evolution tracking through quantum manifolds with stability metrics

2. Financial Analysis (`src/connectors/`, `forex/*`)
- Market data processing with custom technical indicators
- Real-time volatility classification (4 levels)
- Signal generation using logistic chaos mathematics
- Dynamic risk adjustment based on market conditions

3. Memory Management (`src/memory/*`)
- Three-tier memory architecture (STM, MTM, LTM)
- Quantum coherence-based promotion system
- Pattern relationship tracking with strength metrics
- Automatic defragmentation at 30% threshold

## Key Integration Points

1. Pattern Evolution Pipeline
- Quantum state detection in market patterns
- Coherence calculation between related patterns
- Stability metrics based on quantum transitions
- Generation tracking for pattern maturity

2. Trading Signal Generation 
- Resonance threshold validation (>= 0.55)
- Volatility-based pattern matching
- Risk-reward calculation using ATR multipliers
- Pattern performance feedback loop

3. Memory Optimization
- Pattern promotion based on coherence thresholds:
  * STM -> MTM: 0.7 coherence requirement
  * MTM -> LTM: 0.9 coherence requirement
- Relationship strength tracking between patterns
- Quantum state persistence management

The system uniquely combines quantum computing concepts with financial market analysis, using sophisticated pattern recognition and multi-tier memory management to generate trading signals.
